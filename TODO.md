# Todo List

Prepare

    [ ] test the re-stacked image via single line license plate recognition model
    [ ] find the better method to divider the double line license plate

Next

    [ ] test tinyPalm model on real devices
    [ ] using tinyPalm model to train the license plate detection with keypoints
    [ ] affine transform (for LP via four points)
